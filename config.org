* About

2024 refix edition!

This is my personal configuration for GNU Emacs. It is written in a
literate style, combining code snippets and documentation in the same
file.

These days I use Emacs a lot less than I used to when this
configuration was originally written. This means a lot of big features
I used to have are now disabled, and a lot of complexity has been
stripped down. 

In line with the GNU philosophy, this configuration is entirely Free
Software. See the [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]] file in this repository for more
information.

* Text editing features
** Auto-fill text

I like my text to wrap nicely in plain text files. =auto-fill-mode=
does that for me automatically.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

* Appearance

Here we set up fonts, themes, and anything visual.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'modus-operandi)
#+end_src
