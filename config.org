* About

2024 refix edition!

This is my personal configuration for GNU Emacs. It is written in a
literate style, combining code snippets and documentation in the same
file.

These days I use Emacs a lot less than I used to when this
configuration was originally written. This means a lot of big features
I used to have are now disabled, and a lot of complexity has been
stripped down. 

In line with the GNU philosophy, this configuration is entirely Free
Software. See the [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]] file in this repository for more
information.
