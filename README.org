#+title: abe's literate configuration for GNU Emacs
#+author: abe

2024 refix edition!

This is my personal configuration for GNU Emacs. It is written in a
literate style, combining code snippets and documentation in the same
file.

These days I use Emacs a lot less than I used to when this
configuration was originally written. This means a lot of big features
I used to have are now disabled, and a lot of complexity has been
stripped down.

The [[file:config.org][config.org]] file serves as the single point of entry into this
Emacs configuration. There, code is defined and explained.

In line with the GNU philosophy, this configuration is entirely Free
Software. See the [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]] file in this repository for more
information.
